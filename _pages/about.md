Hi! :wave:

I'm a third-year PhD student at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/). I'm an ex Applied Scientist II Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/). My main research focuses on Large Language Models and Sentiment Analysis. 

I don't remember a day in which I was not passionate about computer science and, even more, all its implications. My interests have ranged from programming to graphics, through web development, even video editing, finally leading to artificial intelligence. I assure that this is my final interest... Well, maybe!

I like to teach machines how to [understand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding) human language. The core idea is to help people in their work and create new opportunities.
