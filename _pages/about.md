Hi! :wave:

I'm a second-year PhD student at the [Sapienza Natural Language Processing group](http://nlp.uniroma1.it), advised by [Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli/). My main research focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Entity Linking.

I like to teach machines how to [understand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding) human language. The core idea is to help people in their work and create new opportunities.

I don't remember a day in which I was not passionate about computer science and, even more, all its implications. My interest has ranged from programming to graphics, through web development, even video editing, to then lead to artificial intelligence. I assure that this is my final interest... Well, maybe!
